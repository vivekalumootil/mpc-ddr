# Differential Drive with MPC
This repository simulates a robot that uses an MPC algorithm to attempt to approach a line in a 2D space.

## Dependencies
* scipy
* matplotlib
* numpy

## Instructions
*python3 main.py* to run the simulation.

You may safely change the parameters in the *parameters.py* file. 


## Notes
This repository is useful if you want to create a controls algoritm for a robot to approach a line. The code can easily be modified to have the target line change over the course of execution.

Credits to [this repository](https://github.com/zainkhan-afk/Differential-Drive-Robot-Navigation) for the initial code design.
